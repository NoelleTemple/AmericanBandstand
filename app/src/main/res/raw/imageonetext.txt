This image presents Dick Clark with several dancers on the set of American Bandstand.  This is a staged photo, meaning this is how the show wanted to present itself.  Five teenagers surround Dick Clark, all of which are white.  Four of the five children are women, all wearing long skirts with their hair done up.  This image shows that the studio wanted viewers and advertisers to see that they promoted good behavior in teenagers.  To them, that meant well-dressed kids with no integration on set.
