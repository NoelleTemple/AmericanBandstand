American Bandstand, formally known as Bandstand, was a beloved tv show that was broadcast to the Delaware Valley on WFIL between 1952 and 1957 and nationally on ABC from 1957 to 19X89.  The show featured teenagers dancing to popular music of the time.  Its original location in West Philadelphia made it a hotspot for local teens after school.  However, despite the studioâ€™s proximity to the majority black enrolled public high school, the studio led Jim Crow-like tactics to keep African Americans from participating in the show.  The practice of segregation at American Bandstand displays the underlying racism of the Philadelphia music industry, and advertisement companies in the area.
