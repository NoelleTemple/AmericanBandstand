American Bandstand has an interesting connection to the Civil Rights Movement.  Dick Clark often represented American Bandstand as the pinnacle of integration, writing “I don’t think of myself as a hero or civil rights activist for integrating the show; it was simply the right thing to do” (Delmont Chapter 7).  However, historical evidence has pointed to distinct opposition to the integration process at the studio.  Though the Civil Rights Movement was an important factor in not having an official segregation policy, “antiblack racism in Philadelphia and nationally…motivated the show’s discrimination” (Delmont Chapter 7).  The studio utilized Jim Crow like tactics to keep black teenagers from dancing on the show.  The studio would require teenagers to get approval by mail before the show, and this required an application form.  This form had things like the teenager’s address, school, and name.  The show would often discriminate by selecting students with Italian, Irish, and Jewish last names.  They would also take the teen’s address into account and could deny entry based on the neighborhood they lived in.  However, one of the most important factors was the dress code.  At the doorman’s discretion, they could deny any teen entry based on the clothing they were wearing.  It was not until the show moved to Los Angeles that “the growing strength of the Civil Rights movement…compelled ABC to integrate the program’s audience and dancefloor” (Puckett).
