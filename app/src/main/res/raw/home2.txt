American Bandstand played popular music at the time that included many black artists and songwriters.  Ironically, despite this recognition, the teens in the studio were homogenously white.  WFIL broadcast to areas of four states in an area called “WFIL-adelphia”: Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware (“Nicest Kids in Town” Chapter 1).  At the time, both Maryland and Delaware were resisting integration efforts: “Both Mary land and Delaware maintained de jure segregated school systems until the Brown decisions and resisted court-ordered desegregation for another decade thereafter. Interracial marriage was also illegal in both states until Loving v. Virginia in 1967” (“Nicest Kids in Town” Chapter 1).  As a result, the station catered toward advertising companies who were trying not to make waves on the cusp of a Civil Rights Movement.  While the studio continued to make money for “black artists and labels, the show…was guilty of under-representing the Philadelphia population” (“TV a-go-go” 30).
