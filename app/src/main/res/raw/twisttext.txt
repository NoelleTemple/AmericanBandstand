Chubby Checker kicked off the 60s with his hit “The Twist.”  Though the song has mysterious origins, passing from artist to artist, evidence of the song’s double entendre “began to appear in early twentieth-century African American popular music and blues and [was] fairly common by midcentury” (McCarthy).  A member of the Sensational Nightingales had the original idea for the lyric “Come on baby, Let’s do the twist,” based on a dance his sister would do.  However, despite the song being of gospel origins, the meaning behind it would not uphold the morals of gospel singing, and it finally landed with Hank Ballard and the Midnighters.  The Midnighters were known for songs “with risqué lyrics” (McCarthy).  Dick Clark, host of American Bandstand wanted a version with less sexual implications, and so, using Cameo Parkway Records, recorded Chubby Checker’s version, an almost identical tune.  However, Checker’s recording popularized the song with the help of Dick Clark and American Bandstand.
