One of the tactics used to keep the studio segregated was to require a membership card.  This meant teenagers would need to plan in advance and that the studio could decline membership based on information on the application like neighborhood and last name.  Even if someone were to get a membership card, the studio would still decline entrance based on “dress code” and the capacity of the studio.  On one occasion, a teenager was able to convince the manager to let them in because they called the Tribune, Philadelphia’s African American run newspaper, about the discriminatory practices.  And yet, if black teenagers were permitted inside, or protested outside of the studio, they were often the victims of hate crimes by white teenagers also trying to get inside.
