The two images above show the lack of diversity on set.  The first image shows the teenagers allowed to dance on the show.  The crowded dance floor supports women in dresses dancing with their male counterparts almost all in button-down shirts.  All the kids on stage are white.  The second image captured a featured moment with two dancers.  While the focus is on the two teens dancing in the front, the background presents more interesting views of Bandstand.  The bleachers in the background contain the studio audience for the show.  Here, we can see again that the makeup of the teenagers in the building is white.  One teenager, Joe Fusco, who attended the show regularly from South Philadelphia High School noted, “Because no matter how long those kids waited in that line, somehow someway they didn’t get in, because I used to look to see if they got in later. And in my time going to that show, I only saw two black kids that got in and sat in the bleachers, and he [Dick Clark] paid no attention to them” (Delmont Chapter 7).
