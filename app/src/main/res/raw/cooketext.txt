Sam Cooke, prior to the dance craze of the 1960s, was busy developing the soul genre along with fellow performer Ray Charles.  Cooke recorded a soul rendition of “(I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons.” This song, originally recorded in 1945 by Deek Watson, contains smoother vocals than most blues songs.  Cooke, known for his smooth voice, took on this song and utilizes the signature moan he developed as a gospel singer growing up.  Cooke’s music was known for being able to cross the boundary between black and white audiences.  Heard on American Bandstand in December of 1957, white couples can be seen dancing to Sam Cooke singing “(I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons.”
