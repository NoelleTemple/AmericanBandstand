“The Twist” came with a dance and sparked a trend that other artists and some recording companies would base their music on.  The dance-based song was not only more likely to get audiences to participate in the music but was also more likely to be played on American Bandstand.  Music that was played on American Bandstand easily shot to the top of the charts and musicians like Dee Dee Sharp capitalized on the trend with her hit “Mashed Potato Time.”  The song contains remnants from Sharp’s start singing with her mom in church, as she says in an interview with Dick Clark.  Gospel elements like call and response can be heard between Sharp and the backup singers.  She also occasionally utilizes her own version of the moan with certain shouted elements, an important gospel technique.
