While the performers on American Bandstand provided a diverse playlist, the show itself did not bother to present this music to a diverse audience.  American Bandstand, while ushering along black performers’ careers in the process, capitalized on the popularity of Rhythm and Blues.  This is best described in the makeup of the teenagers who were permitted to dance on the show.  White Philly teens on the show “failed to credit their black counterparts as creators of the steps that they modified and represented as their own” (Puckett).  The black teenagers were not given a chance to present their own steps due to the restrictions that American Bandstand put in place.  Take the quiz to find out if you can bypass the Jim Crow-like restrictions placed on African American teenagers by the American Bandstand studio.
